# Snake-Game
<br/>

This project is my learning of how I built the snake game with python code through Udemy.

## **Getting the Game to Run**

1. Install Python3: Ensure you have Python3 installed onto your computer. Use '<strong>pip install --upgrade pip</strong>' to update pip if neccessary in the terminal.
* If you are running on Windows, the command would be '<strong>py -m pip install --upgrage pip</strong>'. Or use '<strong>pip3 -m pip install --upgrade pip</strong>' if you are using macOS.
2. Clone the Repository: Download or clone the repository from Github to a direcotry of your choice.
* Find and click on the green "<strong>Code</strong>" button at the top of the repository page, copy the URL, and run the following command in your terminal: "<strong>git clone [URL]</strong>.
3. Set Up a Virtural Environment:
* Navigate to the cloned repository folder using your file explore.
* Open a command terminal by typing 'cmd' into the file path line. On macOS, type the command '<strong>cd</strong>'
* Create a virtual enviroment by running: '<strong>py -m venv env</strong>'. This creates a folder named 'env' within your repository to house the virtual environment.
* Activate the virtual environment by running: '<strong>.\env\Scripts\activate</strong>' (on Windows) or '<strong>source env/bin/activate</strong>' (on macOS/Linux). You will see '<strong>(env)</strong>' preceding your directory path, indicating that the virtual environment is active.
4. Run the Program: Execute the program by typing: '<strong>python main.py</strong>' in the command terminal. If you are using Python3, execute the program by typing: '<strong>python3 main.py</strong>'.
* When the code is run through powershell, execute the program by typing: <strong>python .\main.py</strong>'.
6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment: After you are finished with the program, deactivate the virutal environemnt by running: '<strong>deactivate</strong>' in the command terminal.

After running the code, the Snake Game should run and you can play the classic Snake Game on your own computer before you deactivate the virtual environment.

When you have finished playing the Snake Game, close the window using the X button on the top-left or top-right of the corner.
